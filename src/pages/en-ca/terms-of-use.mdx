## Limitation of Liability

Goose shall not be liable for any loss, damage, injury, or claim, nor any special, indirect, incidental, consequential, exemplary or punitive damages of any kind, whether such action is based on tort, contract, negligence, strict liability, or otherwise and even if Goose has been advised of the possibility of such damages, which arises out of or relates in any way to:

If you are in a jurisdiction that does not allow the limitation of liability for certain damages, the above limitation of liability or a portion of it may not apply to you. However, you agree in any event that Goose’s total liability for all damages, losses, injuries, or claims of any kind or nature shall be limited to the amount you have paid to access the Platform.

## Jurisdiction, enforceability, and termination

These Terms of Use and your use of the Platform are governed in all respects by the laws of the Province of British Columbia, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of laws. Any dispute concerning the Platform or these Terms of Use shall be subject to the exclusive venue of a court of competent jurisdiction in Vancouver, British Columbia.

If a court of competent jurisdiction holds any provision of these Terms of Use to be invalid or unenforceable, then such provision shall be severable from and shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions.

These Terms of Use are effective until terminated by either party. You may terminate these Terms of Use without notice to Goose by discontinuing all use of the information contained in the Platform and destroying the materials you have obtained from the Platform, including all related documentation and copies. Goose may terminate these Terms of Use and/or the products or services offered by Goose at any time without notice to you if, in our sole judgment, you breach any term or condition of these Terms of Use. Upon termination, you must discontinue all use of the information contained in the Platform and destroy the materials you have obtained from Goose, including all related documentation and copies.
