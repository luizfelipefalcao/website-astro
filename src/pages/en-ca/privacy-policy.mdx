We are committed to protecting your privacy. Our privacy policy, which complies with all provincial and federal laws, is described below. This policy may be modified by Goose Insurance Services (“Goose”) at any time without notice to you. Please check this page regularly for updates.

## What is Personal Information?

“Personal Information” means information about an identifiable individual. For clarity, information that by itself cannot be connected to an identifiable individual is not considered Personal Information.

## Why is Personal Information Collected and Used?

Goose collects and uses your Personal Information for the purpose of:

1. Promoting, offering, quoting, and selling insurance products to you;
2. Improving the Goose Platform and the various services offered to you on it;
3. Processing and administering your insurance policies for which we act as your agent;
4. Offering you services relating to your insurance policy;
5. Adjudicating your insurance claims;
6. Contacting you in compliance with the law; and,
7. Complying with the law.

We will limit the Personal Information we collect about you to that which is needed to meet these purposes. We will only retain your Personal Information as long as we need it to meet these purposes.

Please be aware that, as part of our use of your Personal Information, we may transfer it for processing in jurisdictions outside of North America, which may not have laws that provide privacy protections that are substantially similar to those in North America.

## Will Personal Information be Disclosed to Others?

We will only disclose your Personal Information to:

1. Independent contractors of Goose or your Insurer to investigate, assist with, or adjudicate your claim;
2. Consumer reporting agencies as governed by the law;
3. Any other third party, if authorized to do so by the law; and,
4. Any other third party, if you provide us with your express consent to do so.

By volunteering your Personal Information to us, you are providing your consent for us to collect, use and disclose your Personal Information as described in this policy. If you provide us with Personal Information about others, you represent that you have obtained their consent for us to collect, use and disclose their Personal Information as described in this policy.

We will make every reasonable effort to keep your Personal Information accurate and up to date.
